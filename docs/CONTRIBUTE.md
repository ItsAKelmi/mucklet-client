# How to contribute

Thank you for helping out making the Mucklet Client better!

## Getting started

If you are new to this project, first get to know the code base a bit.
* Try to [install and run it locally](../README.md#quick-start), connecting to the test server.
* Read the [Understanding the application](../README.md#understanding-the-application) documentation to learn more.
* Try to [create a simple module](./understanding-modules.md#quick-example) to see how that works.

Did it work? Great! Now we are ready to contribute.

## Issues

While there are thousands of great ideas that would make the game better, for now we ask that you focus on the ones that has been added to the list of [issues](). If you see a suitable one, drop a comment on it to let others know you are planning on working on it.

* Let the rest of the community provide input on your idea

## Git flow

The project repository uses [git flow](https://developerexperience.io/practices/git-flow) as branching system. When you fork and create a branch, make use to base it on the `develop` branch, which is the one we work on.

The `master` branch is mainly just for releases.

## Coding conventions

The [style guide](./style-guide.md) explains things like code formatting, code rules, and common patterns used in the project. Don't let the size of the file scare you off. Most of it are examples. The most important points are:

* Use an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin for your IDE.
* Use an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your IDE.
* Follow the conventions you see in the rest of the code.

No worries if your pull request does not follow all the rules. Just be willing to edit your code if asked, or allow someone else to make sure your code follows the rules.

## Pull request

When you are finished with the changes, create a pull request:

* Make sure to [link to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to make it easier to find.
* Be prepared that you might be asked to make some changes before approval.
* Be prepared that Accipiter might do changes to your code after merge as well.

Congrats! And thanks for your contribution!
