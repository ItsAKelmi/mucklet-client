<p>Thank you for supporting Mucklet! These Payment Terms (or just "Terms") are a
supplement to the <a href="terms.html" class="terms link">Terms of
Service</a>, and describes the terms and conditions for payments made to
Mucklet.</p>
<p>By making a Payment or setting up a payment subscription using our purchase
flow, you agree to these Terms. Of course, if you don't agree with them, you can
enjoy the game without making any payments.</p>

<h2>Payment processors</h2>
<p>We use third-party Payment Processors (such as Stripe, PayPal, or others) to
process payments. These Payment Processors may require you to agree to their own
terms and conditions in order to use them.</p>
<p>By providing a payment method, you agree that you are authorized to use that
payment method, and that the information you provide is true and accurate.</p>

<h4>Personal data</h4>
<p>While the Payment Processors may gather and store additional information
about you and your purchase, in accordance to their terms, Mucklet will not
handle or store any personal information gathered by the Payment Processor. But
we will store partial details of your payment method (such as the last four
digits and expiry date of your card), enough to provide you with hints about
which method you used for a payment or subscription. We will also store
geographical information shared by the Payment Processor and derived from your
IP address, sufficient enough to be able to comply with global tax laws.</p>

<h2>Taxes and fees</h2>
<p>Any tax that we are required by applicable law to collect, such as sales
tax, VAT, GST, or similar, will be included in the amount displayed to you. You
are responsible for all other applicable taxes, data plans, internet fees, and
other fees associated with your use of the services.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>You may set up recurring payments, also called Subscriptions. By doing so,
you agree to let us periodically charge your payment method with the amount and
frequency that you have given us mandate to when setting up a subscription. You
can cancel the subscription at any time.</p>

<h4>Billing interval</h4>
<p>Once the first payment is made on a subscription, any recurring payment will
be made on the same time and day of the month as the initial payment. If a month
doesn't have the same day, the payment will be made on the last day of that
month. For example, a monthly subscription with its initial payment being made on
January 31 will recur on February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year), then
March 31, April 30, and so on.</p>
<p>If you set up a new subscription while you have days remaining from previous
payments, the first payment will be scheduled to the date when the remaining
days expire. You will never lose any remaining days by making an additional
payment, or setting up a subscription.</p>

<h4>Cancel subscriptions</h4>
<p>You may cancel a subscription at any time. To cancel a subscription, go to <a
href="/account#overview" class="account overview link">Mucklet - Account
overview</a>, click on the active subscription, click <em>Unsubscribe</em>, and
confirm. Canceling a subscription will stop any new payments to be made on that
subscription, but you will keep access to all the perks and features for the
remaining days of the subscription period.</p>

<h4>Forced cancelation</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to cancel your subscription at any time and for any
reason. If you, as a result of us canceling your subscription, also lose access
to the perks and features that you have paid for, we will refund you
proportionally for the remaining days of the subscription period.</p>
<p>If your account is suspended or banned due to violation of the Terms of
Service or deleted on your own request, your subscription will be canceled
automatically, but no refund will be made for any remaining days of the
subscription period.</p>

<h4>Failed payments</h4>
<p>If we fail to charge your payment method at the end of a subscription period,
we will retry once a day for two consequtive days following the failed attempt.
If all three attempts fail, your subscription will be canceled automatically.
You will keep any perks and features associated with the subscription during the
retry period. The retry period ends when a payment is successful, or the
subscription is canceled.</p>

<h4>Changes in subscription cost</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to change the cost associated with a subscription. For
raised subscription fees, we may, at our sole discretion, continue to charge the
prior subscription fee. Any subsequent cancellations and re-subscriptions will
use the new current rate for the subscription. If we decide to start charging
you a higher fee for your subscription, you will be notified about the change
and given the choice to agree to continue the subscription at the new rate. If
you do not agree, your subscription will be automatically canceled prior to any
payment being made using the higher fee. If we lower the fee of the offer that
you are subscribing to, we will charge you the lower fee, starting with your
next pending payment.</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>We offer refunds in case we have charged you too much, charge you too often,
or in other ways failed to comply with what is stated in these Terms and in the
information provided to you during the payment or subscription setup process. We
will also offer refunds for other reasons not stated, or contradictory to these
Terms, if required by applicable law.</p>
<p>While we try to provide a fun and friendly service that is available at all
times, we do not offer refunds if you regret making a payment, or if you no
longer can access or enjoy the service. This includes, but is not limited to,
our servers being inaccessible, the client not loading on your device, or the
service being blocked in your country. Additionally, if your account is
suspended or banned due to violation of the Terms of Service or in-game rules,
we are not required to compensate you for any loss or make any refunds to
you.</p>
<p>Submit refund requests to <a href="mailto:support@mucklet.com"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link">support@mucklet.com</a>. Each
request will be reviewed by us on a case-by-case basis and eligibility is
determined at our sole discretion.</p>

<h2>Changes in offer</h2>
<p>We may at any time change the content of an offer that you have paid for or
are subscribing to, by adding or removing perks and features included in the
offer.</p>

<h2>Expiration</h2>
<p>When your paid period expires, and you do not have an active subscription
that will renew the period, the functionality and perks included in the offer
will no longer be accessible to your account. Any content that has not been
deleted but can no longer be fully utilized or accessed due to the withdrawn
functionality, will remain downloadable, exportable, or in other ways
retrievable. By starting a new paid period, functionality and content will
return to same accessible state again.</p>
